<Section title="Background" image="development/development_allrecipes_original.png" alt="Example of a recipe website">
<p class="mb-4">Venturing through recipe websites to kill time is a big feature in my life. Unfortunately, recipe websites are often non user-friendly when trying to search for recipes.</p>
<p clas="mb-4">I wondered whether I could come up with a solution to simplify recipe websites.</p>

<p class="mb-8">As a result, I came up with Savory Stash to streamline the recipe search process.</p>

<Section title="Competitive Analysis" reverse="true" image="development/development_competitive_analysis.png" alt="Comparison table of recipe websites">
<p class="mb-4">To ensure Savory Stash was the crème de la crème of recipe websites, I channeled my inner Sherlock Holmes and conducted a thorough competitive analysis of the big players in the game: <CustomLink to="https://www.allrecipes.com/" target="_blank"
    rel="noopener noreferrer">Allrecipes</CustomLink>, <CustomLink to="https://www.yummly.com/" target="_blank"
    rel="noopener noreferrer">Yummly</CustomLink>, and <CustomLink to="https://www.epicurious.com/" target="_blank"
    rel="noopener noreferrer">Epicurious</CustomLink>.</p> 

<p class="mb-4">Armed with <CustomLink to="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/" target="_blank"
    rel="noopener noreferrer">Jakob Nielsen's "10 Usability Heuristics for User Interface Design"</CustomLink>, I left no stone unturned in my quest for usability insights.</p>

<p class="mb-4">Yummly emerged as the star pupil. It offered a array of sorting and filtering options, including even options to filter recipes by taste. Allrecipes and Epicurious, while commendable in their own right, had room for improvement in terms of helping users find that perfect saved recipe.</p>

<p class="mb-4">All three websites offered a ton of sorting and filtering options; however, these features were hidden behind featured sections and curated articles. In addition, searching for saved recipes was separate from searching for recipes in general, which was confusing.</p>

<div class="px-5 md:px-24 2xl:p-32 h-full py-20">
<Section title="Wireframing" image="development/development_wireframing.png" alt="Comparison table of recipe websites">
<p>I thought Savory Stash could have a competitive advantage over the other recipe websites by:<p>
<ul class="list-image-square pl-6 mb-8">
<li><b>Removing featured sections:</b> Removing the featured sections would declutter the interface and allow the user to simply search for recipes without bias</li>
<li><b>Merging search functionality for both non-saved recipes and saved recipes:</b> Using one search bar for all search functionality would reduce the learning curve for new users</li>
</ul>

<Section title="Final Redesign" reverse="true" image="development/development_final_redesign.png" alt="Comparison table of recipe websites">
<p class="mb-4">Armed with my wireframes and a healthy dose of creativity, I put on my design apron and got to work on the final redesign of Savory Stash. I sprinkled in a dash of modern aesthetics, a pinch of intuitive navigation, and a generous helping of mouth-watering visuals.</p>
<p class="mb-8">The result? A recipe website that's as visually appealing as it is functional. Users can now find their favorite recipes faster than they can preheat their ovens.</p>
