<p class="mb-4">Picture this: you're a passionate home cook, eager to explore new culinary horizons, but you find yourself lost in a labyrinth of cluttered recipe websites.</p> 

<p clas="mb-4">Fear not, for I embarked on a quest to simplify your journey and create a recipe website that's as user-friendly as it is delicious.</p> 

<p class="mb-8">Enter Savory Stash, the result of my tireless efforts to streamline your cooking adventures and make your taste buds dance with joy.</p>

<Section title="Competitive Analysis" reverse="true" image="development/development_competitive_analysis.png" alt="Comparison table of recipe websites">
<p class="mb-4">To ensure Savory Stash was the crème de la crème of recipe websites, I channeled my inner Sherlock Holmes and conducted a thorough competitive analysis of the big players in the game: Allrecipes, Yummly, and Epicurious.</p> 

<p class="mb-4">Armed with <CustomLink to="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/" target="_blank"
    rel="noopener noreferrer">Jakob Nielsen's "10 Usability Heuristics for User Interface Design"</CustomLink>, I left no stone unturned in my quest for usability insights.</p>

<p class="mb-4">Yummly emerged as the star pupil, offering a smorgasbord of sorting and filtering options that would make even the pickiest eater swoon. Allrecipes and Epicurious, while commendable in their own right, had room for improvement in terms of helping users find that perfect saved recipe.</p>

<p class="mb-4">All three websites excelled in making their saving features as accessible as a freshly baked cookie, ensuring users never lose sight of their culinary treasures. And when it comes to user control and freedom, these websites made it easier to remove a saved recipe than it is to resist a second helping of grandma's famous apple pie.</p>

In the end, Yummly took the cake with its unparalleled sorting and filtering options, but all three contenders demonstrated their own unique strengths in the world of recipe website usability.

<Section title="Wireframing" image="development/development_wireframing.png" alt="Comparison table of recipe websites">
With the insights from my competitive analysis tucked under my chef's hat, I set out to create wireframes that would make even the most seasoned UX designer salivate. I carefully crafted each element, ensuring that navigating Savory Stash would be as intuitive as following a well-written recipe.
From the home page to the recipe details, I left no user journey uncharted. The wireframes were my blueprint for a website that would not only satisfy your hunger for delectable dishes but also your craving for a seamless browsing experience.

<Section title="Final Redesign" reverse="true" image="development/development_final_redesign.png" alt="Comparison table of recipe websites">
<p class="mb-4">Armed with my wireframes and a healthy dose of creativity, I put on my design apron and got to work on the final redesign of Savory Stash. I sprinkled in a dash of modern aesthetics, a pinch of intuitive navigation, and a generous helping of mouth-watering visuals.</p>
<p class="mb-8">The result? A recipe website that's as visually appealing as it is functional. Users can now find their favorite recipes faster than they can preheat their ovens, and saving those culinary gems is as easy as pie. Savory Stash is the ultimate digital cookbook, ready to guide you on your gastronomic adventures.</p>
