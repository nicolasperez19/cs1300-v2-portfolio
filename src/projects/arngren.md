<Blockquote>A wise man once said, 'just because you can, doesn't mean you should'. The designers of Arngren clearly didn't follow that advice.</Blockquote>

<p class="mb-4">Arngren is a Norwegian e-commerce site. Similar to Craiglist, users can sell classified goods. Arngren mostly focuses on technology and gadgets. It's main categories are ATVs, drones, ebikes, and scooters.</p>

<p class="mb-4">Unfortunately, Arngren is the poster child for what not to do in web design. It's design is a mishmash of colors. It's layout is chaotic. It's user experience resembles navigating through a maze blindfolded. It's no wonder that it's often dubbed as the worst website in the world.</p>

<p class="mb-4">Most designers would tremble at the face of this monstrosity; however, I was determined redesign Arngren from the ground up.</p>

<p class="mb-8">This is a story of how I truned Arngren from an eyesore, to e-commerce excellence.</p>

<Section title="Sketching" reverse="true" image="images/arngren/arngren_sketching.jpeg" alt="Arngren initial sketches">
First things first, I rolled up my sleeves and dived headfirst into the world of rough sketches. Armed with a trusty pencil and a cup of strong coffee, I unleashed my creativity and let the ideas flow. From the ashes of confusion emerged nine sketches, each a glimmer of hope in the darkness of Arngren's current state.

<Section title="Filtering" image="images/arngren/arngren_filtering.jpeg" alt="Arngren revised sketches">
Next came the arduous task of filtering through the chaos to find the diamond in the rough. With a critical eye and a touch of ruthless efficiency, I narrowed down the sketches to a single, glorious design that embodied everything Arngren should aspire to be.

<Section title="Wireframing" reverse="true" image="images/arngren/arngren_lo_fi.png" alt="Arngren low fidelity wireframe">
With the chosen sketch in hand, I set out to transform it into a low-fidelity wireframe. This blueprint of simplicity served as the foundation upon which the new Arngren would rise. Gone were the cluttered pages and confusing navigation, replaced instead by a streamlined interface that put the user first.

<Section title="Style Guide" image="images/arngren/arngren_style_guide.png" alt="Arngren style guide">
Consistency is key, as they say, and so I crafted a style guide to ensure that every pixel of the redesigned Arngren sang in perfect harmony. From colors to typography, every element was meticulously chosen to evoke a sense of trust and professionalism.

<Section title="High-Fidelity Prototype" reverse="true" image="images/arngren/arngren_hi_fi.png" alt="Arngren high fidelity prototype">
With the style guide as my North Star, I set out to create high-fidelity prototypes for mobile, tablet, and desktop viewports. With sleek animations and buttery-smooth transitions, these prototypes breathed new life into Arngren, showcasing its potential as a beacon of modernity in the world of e-commerce.

<p class="mb-8">And finally, the moment of truth arrived. With bated breath and a hint of nervous excitement, I unveiled the final version of the redesigned Arngren to the world. Gone were the days of confusion and frustration, replaced instead by a user experience that was as delightful as it was efficient.</p>

<Section title="Conclusion" reverse="true" image="images/arngren/arngren_conclusion.png" alt="Arngren conclusion">
<p class="mb-4">In a world where bad websites run rampant, I took on the challenge of taming the beast known as "The Worst Website in the World." Armed with a keen eye for design, a wicked sense of humor, and a truckload of patience, I embarked on a journey to transform this digital monstrosity into a beacon of usability and style. Through a combination of wit, sarcasm, and a sprinkle of common sense, I navigated through the treacherous waters of atrocious color schemes, mind-boggling navigation, and content that made a terms and conditions page look like a Pulitzer Prize winner. </p>

The redesigned website now stands as a testament to the power of good design and the importance of never underestimating the impact of a well-placed pun, proving that even the worst website in the world can be transformed into a masterpiece with the right mix of creativity, caffeine, and a designer who isn't afraid to laugh in the face of bad design.
